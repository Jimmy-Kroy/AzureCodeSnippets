## Setting Up Monitoring in Your Azure Subscription:
To get monitoring in your Azure subscription, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Access Azure Monitor**: In the Azure portal, access all Azure Monitor features and data from the Monitor menu.
2. **Enable Monitoring**: Some features start working right away, such as activity logs and platform metrics. Others require configuration, such as diagnostic settings and alerts.
3. **Configure Diagnostic Settings**: Create diagnostic settings to collect detailed data from your resources.
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to be notified when something important happens.
5. **Use Monitoring Tools**: Utilize tools like Metrics Explorer, Log Analytics, and Application Insights to analyze and visualize monitoring data.

Azure Monitor is immediately available when you create an Azure subscription, but some features require additional configuration. You can use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or REST API to set up and view monitoring data.
